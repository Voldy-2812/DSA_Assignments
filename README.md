IT @3rd Sem DSA Assignments <hr>
## Assignment-1
1. Write a program in C to find the third largest from the given array of integers without sorting.
2. Given an array of n integers, write a C program for reversing the contents of the array without using another array.
3. Write a C program to add and subtract two integers having at least 10 digits each.
4. Write a C program to find the frequency of a character present in the text given in a file.
5. Write a program in C to represent a sparse matrix of order n x n efficient way in respect of space.
<hr>

## Assignment-2
1. Write a method duplicate Stack that returns a new stack containing the same elements and in the same order as the stack specified in the parameter. The method should create a new stack and fill it with the same data elements as the given stack. (You do not need to duplicate the contents of the elements.).Before the method finishes, it must restore the contents of the original stack to its original state (same contents in the same order). 
2. Sort the given set of elements present in three stack data structures and put them in a single stack, without using any other variable.
3. <hr>

## Assignment-3
1. Write a function duplicateStack() that returns a new stack containing unique elements in the same order as the given stack specified in the parameter.
Example:
* Suppose the stack contains the elements : 10, 12, 10, 15, 20, 10, 15, 20, 25
* So the duplicate stack should contain the elements: 10, 12, 15, 20, 25
* Once this stack is created, display the contents of the stack and form this stack revert back to the original stack contents.
2. Sort the given set of elements present in three stack data structures and put them in a single stack, without using any other variable.
